            <h3>Water Shocking</h3>
            <img src="images/water-pollution_16688107.png" alt="">
            <p>
                Whether you are opening your pool up for the season, need routine maintenance, 
                just had a wild pool party, just experienced heavy weather, or the water quality 
                has been compromised and t here is a heavy chlorine smell or cloudy colour, we provide 
                pool shocking services.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Pool shocking: </b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Destroys contaminants:</b> Shocking raises the free chlorine level to 
                    a point where it can kill off resilient contaminants, such 
                    as algae and bacteria, that regular sanitizing levels might miss.</li>

                <li><b>Breaks down chloramines:</b> It breaks down combined chlorine (chloramines), 
                    which are the waste products of chlorine that has already been used to sanitize 
                    the water. This eliminates the "strong chlorine smell" 
                    and reactivates the remaining chlorine to do its job.</li>

                <li><b>Achieves breakpoint chlorination:</b> The goal is to have a free chlorine 
                    level at least ten times higher than the combined chlorine level, 
                    a point where all contaminants are destroyed.</li>

                <li><b>Oxidizes organic waste:</b> Shocking oxidizes organic waste like sweat,
                    oils, and other debris that have built up 
                    in the water and can make the chlorine less effective. </li>

            <h3>Water Testing</h3>
            <img src="images/ph-meter_12041895.png" alt="">
            <p>
                The secret to a healthy, sparkling pool isn't just chemicals—it's the right balance. 
                Unbalanced water can cause eye irritation, damage your pool's surfaces and equipment, 
                and provide a breeding ground for harmful bacteria.
                Our expert pool water testing service takes the guesswork out of pool maintenance, providing you 
                with accurate results and customized treatment plans so you can spend less time worrying and more time swimming.
                We provide comprehensive testing checking for free chlorine,
                total chlorine, pH, total alkalinity, calcium hardness, 
                and cyanuric acid (stabilizer).

        <h1>FAQs</h1>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What does a standard pool service include?</h3>
            <p>
                A standard service typically includes skimming the surface, 
                brushing the walls and floor, vacuuming debris, emptying skimmer and pump 
                baskets, backwashing the filter, and testing and 
                balancing the water chemistry (pH, chlorine, alkalinity, etc.).
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How often should my pool be serviced?</h3>
            <p>
                Most pools benefit from weekly professional maintenance. 
                Factors such as pool size, usage, location (e.g., proximity to trees), 
                and weather can increase the required frequency.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do I need a professional service if I have an automatic cleaner?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes. While automatic cleaners save time on debris removal, professional 
                service ensures proper water chemistry balance, equipment inspection, 
                and thorough cleaning of areas the cleaner might miss (like corners).
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How long should I run my pool pump?</h3>
            <p>
                Generally, a pool pump should run for about 8 hours a day in the summer 
                and 6 hours in the winter to ensure adequate water circulation and filtration. 
                The goal is to cycle all the pool's water through the filter at least once daily.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Why is my pool water green/cloudy?</h3>
            <p>
                Green water indicates an algae infestation, often due to improper 
                chemical balance or poor circulation. Cloudy water can be caused by 
                imbalanced chemicals, filtration issues, or fine particles. 
                A professional service can diagnose and treat these issues.
