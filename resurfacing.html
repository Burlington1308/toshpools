        <h1>FAQs</h1>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What does a standard pool service include?</h3>
            <p>
                A standard service typically includes skimming the surface, 
                brushing the walls and floor, vacuuming debris, emptying skimmer and pump 
                baskets, backwashing the filter, and testing and 
                balancing the water chemistry (pH, chlorine, alkalinity, etc.).
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How often should my pool be serviced?</h3>
            <p>
                Most pools benefit from weekly professional maintenance. 
                Factors such as pool size, usage, location (e.g., proximity to trees), 
                and weather can increase the required frequency.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do I need a professional service if I have an automatic cleaner?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes. While automatic cleaners save time on debris removal, professional 
                service ensures proper water chemistry balance, equipment inspection, 
                and thorough cleaning of areas the cleaner might miss (like corners).
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How long should I run my pool pump?</h3>
            <p>
                Generally, a pool pump should run for about 8 hours a day in the summer 
                and 6 hours in the winter to ensure adequate water circulation and filtration. 
                The goal is to cycle all the pool's water through the filter at least once daily.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Why is my pool water green/cloudy?</h3>
            <p>
                Green water indicates an algae infestation, often due to improper 
                chemical balance or poor circulation. Cloudy water can be caused by 
                imbalanced chemicals, filtration issues, or fine particles. 
                A professional service can diagnose and treat these issues.
